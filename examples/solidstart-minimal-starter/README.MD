# Next.js + tRPC

This example shows how you can make a typed query using a minimal implementation of tRPC following [`this as a reference`](https://trpc.io/docs/solid).

> Note: This example uses a community maintained package [`solid-trpc`](https://github.com/orjdev/solid-trpc) and is not officially supported by tRPC.
